Hey all I don't know how you guys are finding this, I don't really know GitHub that well, but thanks for checking it out I guess! I am new to programming in html (if you couldn't tell) and I am trying to learn how to create professional looking websites. I am learning html and css and am excited to finally learn programming languages!
